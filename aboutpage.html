      <br><br>
      <p>  My name is Tate Rowney. I am currently a high school student at the Bay School of San Francisco.
      I am interested in mathematics, science, and programming, and I put significant effort into self-motivated
      study in these fields. I have attended numerous supplementary courses outside of school to further my
      learning, as well as taking on topics from scratch with the Internet as a guide.</p>
      <p>  I also enjoy running (as part of the Bay School Cross-Country and Track teams), as well as reading, and playing the
      cello (which I've been at for over 7 years).</p>
